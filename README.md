# 👋 🌎 Greetings earthlings! My name is Shane Woods. 

I am software engineer currently living in the US 🇺🇸  I’m currently learning Front end (html, css, JavaScript) and some Java ☕. 

I was the kid who took apart his toys to add parts to other toys to make them better. I always enjoy breaking things down to see how they work and rebuilding them. Naturally, I enjoy solving problems and as technology involves I work to stay current. 

# A bit about me: 

- 👪 <br>  I enjoy spending time with my family. Every decision I have made has been with family in mind. 
- 💡   I enjoy gaining inspiration from watching a short clip or comical show often. I believe it is good to start the day with inspiration and a quick laugh. 
- 🗺️   In the near future, I would love to get out and travel to see family I haven't seen in a while and open my eyes to new destinations through travel. 
- 🎭   I have always had a fond appreciation for Art and expression of many flavors. Painting, Music, Poetry, Performance arts to name a few.

Please don't forget to connect with me, I am open to collaboration and looking to share more updates via my social networks as we are mostly remote now I truly enjoy engaging with others and learning from others as much as possible.
